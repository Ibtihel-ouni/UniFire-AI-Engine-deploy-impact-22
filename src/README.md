## üßê Overview <a name = "overview"></a>
The AI engine is our solution encompassing  the analytical capabilities based on the newly desiged ontology. 
It is a foundation enabling navigating the ontology, efficient search, browsing of OER, as well as makes smoother user journey through the portal and creates opportunities for employing the AI-based functionalities.

* The knowledge base that is created, codifies information and then an ontology is developed that reflects associations among different data elements. Ontology-based AI allows the system to make inferences based on content and relationships, and therefore emulates human performance. 

### AI Engine Structure:
* AI Engine is comprised of several fundamental modules which include 
    * a¬†Machine Learning Module
    * a¬†Natural Language Processing Module
    * a¬†Knowledge Representation(Ontology) Module
    * a UI Interface (OpenEdu.ch Platform)
* The core of an AI Engine is implemented as an ontology which may be populated by default with a huge amount of general knowledge (e.g. the whole of Wikipedia in the form of DBPedia)

# Installation:

The code examples rely on a wide range of Python libraries from the Data Science and NLP domains. To facilitate installation, I use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to provide containerized [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments.


- The [installation](Installation/README.md) directory contains detailed instructions on setting up and using a Docker image to run the notebooks. It also contains configuration files for setting up various `conda` environments and install the packages used in the notebooks directly on your machine.
