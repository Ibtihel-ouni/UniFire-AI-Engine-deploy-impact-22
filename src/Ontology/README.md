## Contents
In this folder we present the work done on the ontology. 

* The [Design](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/develop/src/Ontology/Design) folder contains documentation and files relating to the design and implementation of our proposed ontology, as well as detailed description of the ontology components (class hierarchy, class defintions, object properties and data properties), the choices we made in the process and the reasons behind them.

* The [Multilingual Support](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/develop/src/Ontology/Multilingual%20Support) folder contains an app in Django to extend the ontology to house content in multiple languages. A more detailed discussion of the reasons behind it can be found in "Design/README.md"

* The [Access](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/develop/src/Ontology/Access) folder contains code showcasing the navigation of the ontology using Python.
