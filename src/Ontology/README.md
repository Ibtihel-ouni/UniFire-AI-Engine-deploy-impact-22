#  Ontology_Name

## Contents
In this folder we present the work done on the ontology. 

* The "Design" folder contains all the files relating to the finalized ontology, as well as a document with a detailed description of the ontology, of the choices we took in the process and the reasons behind them.
* The "Multilingual Support" folder contains an app in Django to extend the ontology to house content in multiple languages. A more detailed discussion of the reasons behind it can be found in "Design/README.md"
