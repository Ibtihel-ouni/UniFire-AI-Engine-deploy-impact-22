## Search engine/Demo app
![Alt Text](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/blob/main/src/NLP/Content%20Search/Demo%20App/search_engine_video.gif)

[This folder](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/main/src/NLP/Content%20Search/Demo%20App) stores all the files related to the search engine. We built an experimental semantic search engine for the OpenEdu platform by building and deploying a demo app on Python using the Streamlit library. The engine processes the text input provided in the search bar, queries the content currently available on the SQL database dump provided, and provides a list with 10 resources that best match (in semantic similarity terms) the search query. The app is up and running (temporarily) at this [link on the Streamlit cloud](https://slashlan-test-streamlit-openedu-search-engine-app-test-0qqrve.streamlit.app/). 


## Recommendation
[This folder](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/main/src/NLP/Content%20Recommendation) includes lisitng similar content within the existing OpenEdu Contents and the topics predicton for the new content.

## Upload
[This folder](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/main/src/NLP/Content%20Upload) consists of AI-based autofill functionality for the uploading processs.

## Moderation
[This folder](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-e/tree/main/src/NLP/Content%20Moderation) groups all the NLP functionalities we developed for the moderation system of the OpenEdu platform such as License Checker, Link Checker, Content moderation and Similarity check.

## Ontology Learning Experiments
